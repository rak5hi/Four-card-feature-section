## Description

This is a solution to the [Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK).

Note: I used different images(/icons).


## My proccess 

- Used margin-inline to center the header section
- Used grid for main content, which is if not mentioned create single column
- Used @media and grid-template-columns to change grid single column to 3 column if the width is greater than 800px
- And for each grid column set the align-content to center to vertically centers the card 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- CSS [Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp)

### What I learned

- main tag should be used only once per html document.

- margin-inline and padding-inline used for horizontally center

- margin-block and padding-block used for vertically center

- [units](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.php) 
    - rem = root em ,relative browser base font-16px
    - fr = fractional unit, 1fr is 1 part of available space
    - 1vh = 1% of viewport 
    - svh = smallest viewport height
